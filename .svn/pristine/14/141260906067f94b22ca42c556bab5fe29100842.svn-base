-- Inshi No Heya and Hashiwokakero game solver --

INSTALL :

To compile both solvers, just run "make" at the root of this directory.
If you want to compile only one of those solvers, simply go in the solver directory then run "make".


UNINSTALL :

You can use "make cleanall" to remove any binary files you've made. As for the installation, you can
do it for both solvers at once or only one.


------ Current state of the solvers -----

The Hashiwokakero solver can resolve grids from different square sizes (at least, the ones we tried).
It also can detects badly encoded grids. See "How to use" section below.

The Inshi no Heya solver can resolve grids that have rooms of small size (max 2, or 3 if one of the cells is a "1").
It will print a message to tell if the grid has been solved or not, and, if it has been, will output the solved grid into a .txt file.


------ How to use Hashiwokakero ------

CREATING A GRID :

The encoding used for Hashiwokakero is fairly simple : just create a plain text file and create your grid using
thoses characters (each line in the file being a line on the graph):

- _ for an empty slot
- A number between 1 and 8 to indicate the value of the island.

Any other character (even a blank) will result in a "invalid character" error.

USING THE SOLVER BINARY :

You can resolve a grid by calling the Hashiwokakero binary file and using the path of the grid file as a first argument.
Example : "./hashiwokakero ../test/test1.txt"

Some test grids are bundled with the sovler. See the test directory to find them and read tests.txt for a short description
of what result you should expect.


------ How to use Inshi no Heya ------

CREATING A GRID :

In order to create a grid, you will need to add the following data into a new empty file :
- the size of the grid on the first line ("5x5" or just "5"),
- for each room, read from left to right and top to bottom in the grid, a line that tells its
  product value, 'b' if it goes downwards or 'r' if it goes rightwards, and its length (such as "6b2").

Each room has to be listed only once and on a line on its own.

USING THE SOLVER BINARY :

Similarly to Hashiwokakero, the solver can be called by giving it the path to the file containing the grid to solve.
Example : "./inshiNoHeya ../test/3x3_Custom".

Tests grids are provided within the test folder. Their names indicate their size and what makes them particular compared
to the other grids, such as "singles" for a grid that only has rooms of one cell or "invalid" for a grid that is either 
not readable or not solvable.
