This file is given with the intended role of describing every test files that 
is available within this directory. Each test file is named with the size of 
the grid it contains and the particularity or the origin of that grid.

These tests can be automated with the usage of "make test" and/or "make invalid"
within the appropriate folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2x2_Invalid : 
The grid is not solvable due to having two single-celled rooms with the same 
product on the same row.

3x3_Invalid :
The grid is not valid due to having a room larger than the size of the grid.

4x4_Invalid :
The grid is not solvable due to having a room whose product cannot be made by 
the numbers available.

5x5_Invalid :
The grid is not valid due to having a character other than the ones accepted 
where the direction character would be.

6x6_Invalid :
The grid is not valid due to having one of its room with a product of 0.

7x7_Invalid :
The grid is not valid due to having random characters instead of the room 
product or the room length on some of its lines.

16x16_Invalid :
The grid is not valid due to not having enough rooms/cells to fill up a grid of
its intended size.

3x3_FirstLine :
The grid is valid and solvable. The size specifier on its first line is written 
in its shorthand form (eg. "3" instead of "3x3").

3x3_Spacing :
The grid is valid and solvable. There are multiple line breaks within file, this
allows us to confirm the readability of the grid even if lines are skipped.

4x4_Singles :
The grid is valid and solvable. Every room of this grid has a length of a single
cell.

5x5_Columns :
The grid is valid and solvable. Every room of this grid is a vertical room and 
has a length of the size of the grid itself.

5x5_Rows :
The grid is valid and solvable. Every room of this grid is an horizontal room 
and has a length of the size of the grid itself.

5x5_Rapport :
The grid is valid and solvable. It is the transcription of the grid that has 
been used in documents related to this project.

5x5_Wikipedia :
The grid is valid and solvable. It is the transcription of the grid that is on 
the Inshi no Heya page of Wikipedia.
