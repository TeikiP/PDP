-- Inshi No Heya and Hashiwokakero game solver --

INSTALL :

To compile both solvers, just run "make" at the root of this directory.
If you want to compile only one of those solvers, simply go in the solver directory then run "make"

UNINSTALL :

You can use "make cleanall" to remove any binary files you've made. As for the installation, you can
do it for both solvers at once or only one.


------ Current state of the solvers -----

The Hashiwokakero solver can resolve grids from different square sizes (at least, the ones we tried).
It also can detects badly encoded grids. See "How to use" section below.







------ HOW TO USE ------

CREATING A GRID :

The encoding used for Hashiwokakero is fairly simple : just create a plain text file and create your grid using
thoses characters (each line in the file being a line on the graph):

- _ for an empty slot
- A number between 1 and 8 to indicate the value of the island.

Any other character (even a blank) will result in a "invalid character" error.

USING THE SOLVER BINARY :

You can resolve a grid by calling the Hashiwokakero binary file and using the path of the grid file as a first argument.
Example : "./hashiwokakero ../test/test1.txt"

Some test grids are bundled with the sovler. See the test directory to find them and read tests.txt for a short description
of what result you should expect.
